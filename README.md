## Overview
The Trader Starter Kit code is designed to assist traders in analyzing trends, identifying buying low and selling high opportunities, and executing trade entries based on the T.A.E (Trend Analysis and Entry) framework. It includes several functions that perform these tasks.

## Functionality

### TrendAnalysis
The `TrendAnalysis` function analyzes the trends in the market by checking for higher highs and higher lows. It returns true if either an uptrend or downtrend is detected.

### AreaOfValue
The `AreaOfValue` function calculates the area of value in the market by finding the highest and lowest prices. It returns the difference between the highest and lowest prices.

### TradingRangeAnalysis
The `TradingRangeAnalysis` function identifies buying low and selling high opportunities by finding the highest and lowest prices and calculating the buy low and sell high levels based on a 20% range.

### EntryTrigger
The `EntryTrigger` function is the entry-trigger function based on the T.A.E framework. It calls the `TrendAnalysis` and `AreaOfValue` functions to determine if a trade entry should be executed based on the current price and market conditions.

### OnTick
The `OnTick` function is the main function that is called on each tick of the market. It provides sample data for testing the `EntryTrigger` function by passing in arrays of highs, lows, and prices.

### OnDeinit
The `OnDeinit` function is used for testing and debugging purposes. It can be used to add code for testing and debugging the code.

## Usage
To use the Trader Starter Kit code, follow these steps:
1. Import the necessary libraries, such as `Trade.mqh`.
2. Call the `EntryTrigger` function with the required data (highs, lows, and prices) to execute trade entries based on the T.A.E framework.
3. Customize the code as needed for your specific trading strategy.
